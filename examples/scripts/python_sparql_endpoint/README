This is a toy sparql-endpoint written in Python.

Requirements:

rdflib  (rdf library)
cherrypy (web server)


Use:

1. Run sparqlEndpoint.py

in the terminal type:
$ python sparqlEndpoint.py

This will load trout_quintet.n3 into the store
(plus some trivial example included in the python script)
and create a SPARQL-endpoint on localhost:8081.

You should see the web service engine starting.


2. in another terminal window, run the query:

$ python queryExample.py

A trivial query grabs all literals of the predicate 'dc:title'.

If all is well you should see (among others):

Recording of the LSO performing the Trout Quintet
Trout Quintet, performed by the LSO, on 'Favorite Classics'
Trout Quintet, performed by the London Symphony Orchestra
Franz Schubert's Trout Quintet
